# Food App Project

This project is a dynamic and interactive food application designed to showcase various food items categorized into multiple types. It uses modern web development technologies to deliver an excellent user experience.

## Features

- **Food Categories**: Includes categories such as Salad, Rolls, Desserts, Sandwiches, Cake, Pure Veg, Pasta, and Noodles, with predefined content.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Employs React.js components like `Fooditem` for reusability and modularity.
- **Cart and Checkout**: Implements functionality to add items to the cart and proceed to checkout.
- **Backend Integration**: Configured Express.js backend for managing API routes.
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Uses an assets file (`Assets/Images.js`) to dynamically load food items.
- **Interactive UI**: Features animations and responsive designs for better user engagement.
